# Runno Fonts

The fonts used on the Runno website are licensed and cannot be distributed. This
means that they won't be checked into the git repo. If you're wondering why
they're not here, that's why!

The two typefaces are:

- MD IO - Monospace Code - https://www.futurefonts.xyz/mass-driver/io
- Tobias - Serif Headers - https://displaay.net/typeface/tobias/

You are welcome to purchase your own license for them if you'd like them to work
locally. Otherwise you'll just have to rely on the fallbacks. Sorry!

The required files should be in folders structured like this:

```
fonts/md-io/md-io-bold.woff
fonts/md-io/md-io-bold.woff2
fonts/md-io/md-io-regular.woff
fonts/md-io/md-io-regular.woff2
