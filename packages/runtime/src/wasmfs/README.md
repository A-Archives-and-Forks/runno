# Wasmfs

This is a modified version of [@wasmer/wasmfs](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-js)
with browser support improved by removing the dependency on `tar-stream`. This
was necessary for the current build setup.

At this point in time I've included the license file from there because not enough
work has been done to differ this from the original package.
